# Helm Charts

This repository contains Helm charts written by yours truly, usually for
applications that lack an officially or (widely adopted) community supported
chart.

The hope for this repository is to provide charts that can be used in production
environments. When there is not an official container image, these charts will
pick a [LinuxServer](https://linuxserver.io) image, as they are well maintained
and have a good reputation.

If you find any of these charts useful and have changes you'd like to see, feel
free to submit an issue or a pull request. Additionally, consider these to be
public domain.
